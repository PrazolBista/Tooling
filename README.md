# Tooling

I will just be writing random tools that I require in daily basis

**pdftojpeg.sh**
It will just convert PDF to Jpeg as the name suggests.

**jpg-png-viceversa**
Just like the name, nothing so fancy about it.

**javascript-input-fields.sh**
  The JavaScript-Enabled Input Field Finder is a simple Bash script that allows you to quickly identify input fields on a website that have JavaScript events explicitly set on them..
